# Marketplace challenge:

Below is my thought process and approach to challenge 2 within the time given. I decided to focus on the marketplace since it is an integral part of the application and experience.

Problem:
Most of the Marketplace mockups provided were clear and straight forward, but I struggled to quickly understand the different elements on the right side of each box. You mentioned trust, visibility, readability, urgency, and ease of understanding as goals, and I thought some of those could be improved in this specific area. My struggle for understanding came from the fact that there were different elements depending on what status the offering was in.


My approach was to:

1. standardize the appearance of information regardless of offering status

2. highlight current status for quicker comprehension

3. rearrange info for stronger call to action

4. connect common elements with a stronger hierarchy


My solution delineates, normalizes, and slightly reorganizes the right hand side for stronger comprehension:

1. a vertical rule separates the right hand side, “current status” from the left, “informational”

2. status text color corresponds to current status and icon color

3. investment amounts always appear in the same place, are centered, and clearly called out in each block

4. percentage funded is near the invest button for a stronger call to action



Given more time, I would make the following improvements:

1. use Sass and BEM - I was building as I went and used vanilla CSS - I would rebuild it in Sass, make variables and nest things in a better way

2. use a grid - layout was done by eye only, I would assure everything snaps to a grid

3. make design responsive, define break points

4. use React to render components
